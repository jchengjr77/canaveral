## Question
I have a question about usage of Canaveral that isn't related to a bug or feature request...  
Please describe your question as specifically as you can. If you really want to know one thing and ask another, you drastically increase the risk of running into the ![XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/). Please try to avoid this whenever possible, for everyone's sake.

## Documentation Improvements
If you believe that your question could be answered by the documentation better than it currently is, please include where you would expect to find it in the documentation.
