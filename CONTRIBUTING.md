# Introduction

### Thank you!

Canaveral appreciates your help. Contributors like yourself drive the progress of Canaveral.

These guidelines are meant to reduce friction between developers, striving towards quick and clean contributions. As Hoodie puts it:

> Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What contributions are we looking for?

TLDR: Any Help Is Appreciated.

Whether it is documentation improvements, feature PRs, bug finds/fixes, DevOps improvements, new deployment methods, etc, a contribution makes Canaveral a better tool for everyone.

# Ground Rules

When interacting with other contributors or developers:

- Be respectful in communication
- Be considerate of others' time (we love concise writing)
- Be warm and welcoming to newcomers (if you are not one)

Regarding technical responsibilities:

- Always write tests for code you are committing (we use `go test`)
- Always add relevant tests to the CI file (we use Github Actions, you will see a `go.yml`)
- Keep versions and/or PRs small (preferably one feature per PR or version)
- Write organized, factored, and well-commented code (so other developers can understand it)
- Write meaningful commit messages (one header, followed by concise details)

# Your First Contribution

Welcome! We aren't the best teachers for open source contributing, so here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can start with:

Have fun!

# How to report a bug

### Security Disclosures

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email jonathanchengjr77@gmail.com instead.

### Bug Report

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?
   General questions should go to the golang-nuts mailing list instead of the issue tracker. The gophers there will answer or ask you to file an issue if you've tripped over a bug.

# Suggest a Feature

### Email a Creator!

Right now we are working on expanding Canaveral's functionality and network. If you think there is a valuable feature that we have overlooked, please contact us! We would be more than happy to chat.

# Code Review

We want not only the Creators to review code, but also at least one other person. Your code is ready to go when:

- At least **one** creator has reviewed and approved.

If you disagree with a review comment or change, we are open to discussion via Github and/or email. See the README.md for contact details.
